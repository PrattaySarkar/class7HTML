# Grade 7 HTML Unordered Lists

## Introduction

Welcome to the Grade 7 HTML Unordered Lists project! This project is designed to help students understand and create unordered lists in HTML. Unordered lists are used to display items in a bulleted format, making them ideal for lists where the order of items does not matter.

## What You Will Learn

In this project, you will learn:

- The basic structure of an HTML document
- How to create unordered lists using the `<ul>` tag
- How to add list items using the `<li>` tag
- How to style unordered lists using CSS

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the unordered list.
- `styles.css`: A CSS file for styling the unordered list.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Grade 7 HTML Unordered Lists</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Favorite Fruits</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Cherries</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```
This is the code that we will be dissecting today, To understand its Function.

## Adding List Items

Inside the `<ul>` tag, you can add as many list items as you like using the `<li>` tag. Each `<li>` tag represents one item in the list.

```html
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Cherries</li>
</ul>
```
